    Mike node-lipsum is a NodeJS Module and Command-line Interface combo
    that       provides a service API for lipsum.com, which you may or may not
    know as       the go-to place to generate arbitrary dummy text whenever
    you need it.       Node-lipsum can be used right from the command line by
    invoking       node-lipsum (assuming you've installed it globally) or as a
    node module.       When used as a node module, you can also get access to
    it's service and       parser sub-modules, which can provide fine-grain
    access to lipsum.com's       service.
