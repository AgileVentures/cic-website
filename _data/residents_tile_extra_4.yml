  - title: What is Social Prescribing 4?
    text: Social prescribing works alongside and supports traditional medical
      interventions by linking people up to voluntary and community groups and
      other non-clinical services. Social prescribing is a way to help people
      make positive changes in their lives by giving them the knowledge, skills
      and the confidence to do so.
