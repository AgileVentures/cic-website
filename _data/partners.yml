      Today and community sector provides a wide range of services to support
      the health and wellbeing of residents in Kensington & Chelsea, Queens Park
      and Paddington. It also works closely alongside colleagues from the
      Council and local NHS services to help inform the local health agenda.
      Currently, Social Prescribing is on the National agenda but what is it?


      **More about us?**


      Social prescribing works alongside and supports traditional medical interventions by linking people up to voluntary and community groups and other non-clinical services. Social prescribing is a way to help people make positive changes in their lives by giving them the knowledge, skills and the confidence to do so.


      **What is Self-Care?**


      Self-Care is the action that people take to maintain and improve their own health and wellbeing.
