    sub_title: "About us "
    text: Community Health West London is a Community Interest Company (CIC),
      originally set up by (Kensington and Chelsea Social Council (KCSC), the
      Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea’s recognised voluntary sector
      ‘infrastructure’ organisation.  In 2018, funding from West London CCG
      enabled KCSC to work with local voluntary and community sector colleagues,
      to develop the governance structure of the CIC and set it up as vehicle
      for organising and managing consortia of local ‘not for profit’
      organisations which provide health and wellbeing services to local
      residents.  The CIC has a democratic structure, with shares owned by KCSC,
      a Board of Directors consisting of senior representatives from a
      consortium of six organisations, and the potential for many other local
      organisations to take part in development and decision-making processes.
