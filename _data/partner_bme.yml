    text: The BME Health Forum is a unique and well-established partnership between
      voluntary and community organisations, healthcare providers,
      commissioners, and local authorities. It improves the quality of health
      and social care services for patients from deprived backgrounds living
      primarily in Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster, and aims to reduce
      health inequalities affecting Black and Minority Ethnic Communities.
